#+TITLE: Delta Autoretreat Simulation
#+AUTHOR: Ricardo Hernández M.

This Python code simulates the autoretreat of a delta when the downstream base
level rises. It assumes a fixed sediment feed location. 

* Usage
  Run the =autoretreat.py= file. The input parameters are hard-coded in there
  for the time being. I'll get around to fixing it later. 

* Output
  Expect a bunch of text files with columns of data, a couple of log files and
  at least one plot. Maybe.
