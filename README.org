* Delta Autoretreat Simulation

This Python code simulates the autoretreat of a delta when the downstream base
level rises. It assumes a fixed sediment feed location. 

** Usage
   Run the =autoretreat.py= file. The input parameters are hard-coded in there
   for the time being. I'll get around to fixing it later. 

** Output
   Expect a bunch of text files with columns of data, a couple of log files and
   at least one plot. Maybe.
